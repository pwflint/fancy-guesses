## Intro

Hello.

This is an amateur exploration of data science, what I refer to as "the Art of making Fancy Guesses."

## Middle

This is the landing page. It will briefly introduce the premise and manage expectations. I suspect it will have no code.

## Thoughts

I am using the "sketchy" theme. I like how it styles out the \<divs\>, but I think the body font needs to be cleaner (sans serif, modern) and I'd like to change the h1 fonts to Fredericka.

There is currently a sidebar and a navbar but we probably only need one for starting out.

### Code Examples

```{r}
#| output: false
1 + 1
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
1 + 1
```
